ros-kinetic-eband-local-planner (0.3.0-2xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * slow down trajectory controller while close to goal. closes #19 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/19>.
  * convert info message to debug. closes #18 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/18>.
  * clear local costmap if global plan cannot be converted to band even on first attempt. see #5 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/5>

ros-kinetic-eband-local-planner (0.2.2-2xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * fixed catkin lint warnings in preparation for v0.2.2 release
  * added a bit more paramterization of the algorithm to help navigation in simulation. all changes are backwards
    compatible. #17 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/17> from utexas-bwi/piyushk/fix_simulation_navigation
  * made some changes for a future Indigo release. fixed Eigen dependency (#16 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/16>)

  * added jack as a maintainer for the package
  * 0.2.0
  * updated changelogs in preparation of v0.2.0
  * changing some fudge factors
  * removed band hack. attempting band repair algorithm now
  * changes to hysteresis loop. still has some problems
  * fixed indentation. closes #10 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/10>
  * eband_local_planner now fails when new frames cannot be added to the band. closes #9 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/9>

ros-kinetic-eband-local-planner (0.1.2-2xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * stopped publishing empty bubble heading message. closes #6 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/6>
  * reenabled holonomic drive control. still untested since groovy/hydro migration. closes #2 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/2>

ros-kinetic-eband-local-planner (0.1.0-2xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * add include directory to installation
  * removed redundant file
  * introduced some hysteresis between turning to final orientation and
    turning towards the next bubble. closes #3 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/3>
  * returning trajectory controller's opinion on whether the goal has been reached or not. closes #4 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/4>
  * removed unnecesary print statements
  * some debug statements to help find issues with hydro-devel costmap
  * fixed all runtime loading errors in process of catkinization
  * removing unneeded/untested launch files. I'll add working examples later as the package sees a public release.
  * catkinizing eband_local_planner against the hydro-devel branch of navigation
  * removing standalone follow trajectory ndoe
  * promoting eband local planner to separate repository in preparation for catkinization
  * some improvements to navigation
  * fixed a bug in the eband trajectory controller
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:utexas-bwi/segbot_apps
  * in-place rotation at goal now supported
  * merged goal tolerance parameters between local planner and trajectory controller.
  * add launch for e-band navigation
  * changed distance check to not include orienation. I am not even sure why orientation was being used to check overlap.
  * a couple more parameters + better velocity limit checking
  * fixed for the regular nav stack launch file as well. closes #1 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/1>
  * hmm not sure why this file was here
  * fix for the eband costmap having an incorrect topic. #1 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner/issues/1>
  * updated launch file to use any visualization configuration + reorganized eband configuration file
  * fixed a problem with requesting obstacle distances at the edge of the costmap - these regions are now assumed to be free (optimism) - removes problem with the global plan being regenerated over and over again as new parts of the global plan were converted to the band
  * hack for global planner not catching up in case of an unexpected obstacle snapping band
  * changed INFO statements to DEBUG
  * checking in new parameters for the eband local planner
  * inital differential drive trajectory controller - looks pretty good. needs a bit more code improvent, dynamic reconfigure and stricter obstacle testing
  * Revert "checking in Paul's changes to get eband local planner to work with our differential drive robot". I am seeing some problems with his changes, will apply by hand.
    This reverts commit c925f7e1d5bebbf8c102a2292429749da84562a9.
  * checking in Paul's changes to get eband local planner to work with our differential drive robot
  * added git ignore settings
  * changes to make eband_local_planner compile with navigation 1.9 + groovy
  * copy of eband_local_planner from navigation_experimental.
  * removed some unnecessary launch files and added an rviz configuration + launch file for testing autonomous navigation
  * basic amcl + move base demo works (but is not very good)
  * removed old ens basement maps from the repo
  * removed joy gmapping file - joystick control not directly supported
  * removed redundant sensor files (moved to segbot_sensors)
  * initial port of of navigation and controller code from the svn repository
  * first commit
